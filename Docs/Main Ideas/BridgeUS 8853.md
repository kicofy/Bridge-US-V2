# Concept Narrative

Concept ID: 8853  
**BridgeUS**  
**I. Problem:** In the 2025 academic year, according to the Open Doors Report, the US received 1.2 million international students, about 6% of its higher education enrollment. However, the vast majority of these international students lack access to credible support programs to help them adjust to their new environment. For example, an international student from China hoped to expand her educational opportunities and cultivate a student community on campus. However, she struggled with the tuition fees, maintaining health insurance, and navigating work regulations under a foreign visa. A student from Mexico struggled with isolation from his community and distance from family. Additionally, a student in Florida struggled with depression stemming from feelings of anxiety and misplacement. With all of these students, the language barrier and the lack of family and community support hindered their academic success and potential career opportunities.  
As a result, the Keystone Education Group’s 2025 Student Survey found that many students turn to social media as a tool to learn about US universities and their environments, with 59% claiming social media provides key information. Unfortunately, according to the UK Safer Internet Centre’s research, across social media apps (e.g. Xiaohongshu, Instagram, and TikTok) 48% of young adults encounter unreliable advice every day. As an increasing number of platforms use AI, a Statista survey found that 60% of users are concerned about deep fake videos and false information. Current platforms fail to prevent harmful content because of the lack of fact-checking and transparency. International students become reliant on social media in order to navigate in their new environments on campus and in the city because there is a lack of adequate support systems for a diverse range of situations.  
 International students are particularly vulnerable to misinformation. Colleges warn about scammers on social media that target international students for financial and personal information. Social media is often abundant with sponsored content, paid promotions: fake testimonials, and misleading reviews. International students often struggle to identify and avoid this propaganda because of language barriers and unfamiliarity with American social media platforms. As more international students turn towards social media for advice on how to navigate social and educational environments, there is a clear need for a credible and accessible platform to help them adjust.   
**II. Solution:** Our solution is BridgeUS — a community-driven social media platform that combines user-contributed information, live human help, and AI-supported responses. BridgeUS allows students to find answers and give advice based on their own experiences.The name reflects the mission: “Bridge” represents closing gaps in information and connection, while “US” refers both to the United States and “us” as a community. BridgeUS offers practical guidance on everyday challenges such as transportation, housing, and adapting to school life. Inspired by the Schoolhouse platform, BridgeUS provides live help for personalized questions alongside AI-supported instant responses for common needs, ensuring timely support without sacrificing accuracy or human understanding. All content is evaluated based on usefulness, credibility, and accuracy.    
**Credibility and Privacy:** BridgeUS prioritizes information accuracy, user safety, and privacy through intentional incentive design. The platform uses three complementary rating systems: 1\. Helpfulness- how useful other users find their contributions; 2\. Accuracy- feedback from users who applied the advice; 3\. Credibility- based on verified background information   
Inspired by Reddit, the traditional “like” button has been replaced with “helpful” and “not helpful” buttons, shifting evaluation from popularity to usefulness. Contributors build helpfulness scores based on how the advice impacts their lives rather than how many likes the post receives.  
To further improve information accuracy, BridgeUS includes a post-use “accuracy” system inspired by Taobao, where users leave feedback after applying the information to their lives. This feedback is visible to all users for reference. Accuracy ratings increase a contributor’s accuracy score and reward users who provide follow-up feedback, reinforcing information quality and user interaction.  
To offer credibility without sacrificing privacy, BridgeUS uses a profile-based verification system. Users may submit background details such as school level, occupation, or time spent abroad, along with optional documentation that is reviewed privately by the platform. Only high-level identifiers are displayed publicly, while all personal data is stored privately. Once verified, users receive a visible credibility indicator and score on their profile, signaling that their background information has been confirmed by the platform. Verified information also increases a user’s credibility score, allowing anonymity while maintaining accountability. Moreover, to participate in live human chat, users are required to complete identity verification through secure ID submission. This ensures that interactions are respectful and safe.   
All scores encourage responsible participation and allow contributors to earn incentives such as bookstore gift cards, reinforcing accuracy and effort rather than attention or profit.  
**Unique Values**: Unlike similar platforms such as the Xiaohongshu, which are saturated with ads and paid promotions, BridgeUS prohibits money-driven content. Posts that resemble advertisements are filtered through AI screening, manual review, and community feedback.   
We prioritize trust and transparency over clicks or virality. While this limits scale, it allows BridgeUS to succeed where others fail: offering international students a supportive space to help each other and feel less alone during a critical transition. With this approach long-term growth emerges organically as users share the platform’s trustworthiness, reliability, and helpfulness.  
**III. Web Design:** AI plays a core role in how BridgeUS delivers accessible, efficient, and safe support to international students. Rather than replacing human interaction, AI is integrated to expand access, reduce friction, and support platform moderation, directly reinforcing the community-driven solution described earlier.  
**Accessibility & Inclusiveness:** BridgeUS uses AI-powered language support to automatically translate posts, responses, and questions into multiple languages. Additionally, its intelligent recommendation algorithm analyzes user searches and browsing preferences to provide targeted content. These features allow students with different languages and backgrounds to access information efficiently without barriers.  
**Convenience & User Experience:** The platform includes an AI Q\&A feature that allows users to ask quick questions related to international student life and receive immediate responses, or it will guide to relevant community posts. This reduces search time while encouraging engagement with peer-contributed content.  
**Safety, Privacy, and Trust:** BridgeUS is committed to protecting user privacy and data. User identities and personal information are properly managed and not disclosed to other users. BridgeUS also plans to integrate with Yoti, a leading provider of secure identity verification services, to verify user identities.  
Overall, the website design emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and scalability, ensuring that technology supports human connection, and reliable information.  
**IV. Promotion & Sustainability Model:** BridgeUS is designed as a mission-first, non-profit platform, with a sustainable model focused on keeping core resources free while covering essential operating costs.  
**Promotion**: We reached out to several university international student offices (e.g., ISSS, OGS) to reach students through emails, orientations, and official resource pages. In return, BridgeUS provides additional peer-based support for their international students during transition periods.  
**Funding**: The platform is sustained through limited, vetted advertising from student-relevant partners such as school bookstores and verified service providers, alongside optional donations. Ads are clearly labeled, separated from community content, and governed by a published ad policy and partner verification process to prevent commercial bias.  
**Cost-awareness:** The domain costs $17 per year, the server costs $50–$100 per month, and if there are an estimated 100 users, AI API usage would cost about $20 per month. We will also include a donation option to support moderation and keep core resources free, with full transparency and no impact on content ranking.  
**V. Inspiration:** BridgeUS was inspired by a team member’s experience moving to the U.S. and struggling with language barriers, isolation, and limited access to support. While navigating this transition, she recognized the power of social platforms to share authentic experiences and reach students facing similar challenges. This insight motivated the creation of BridgeUS as a space to connect international students and provide reliable social and educational support during a critical period of adjustment.

Current platforms fail to prevent harmful content because of the lack of fact-checking and transparency.   
As more international students turn towards social media for information, there is a clear need for a credible and accessible platform to help them adjust. International students are vulnerable to misinformation. Multiple colleges warn about scammers on social media that target international students for financial and personal information. Social media is often abundant with sponsored content and paid promotions that often provide misleading information: fake testimonials and reviews.

However, she struggled with the higher tuition fees, maintaining health insurance, and work regulations under foreign visas. A student from Mexico struggled with isolation from his community, distance from family, and the lack of information regarding resources and organizations. In Florida, a newly arrived international student struggled from depression stemming from culture shock: feelings of misplacement and anxiety. There was a lack of family and community support, and the student faced significant language barriers that hindered their academic and career opportunities.

# Concept

**Platform supporting international students who are new to the US**  
Objectives

- Provide international students with trustworthy, accurate, and up-to-date information  
- Reduce confusion, stress, and isolation when adjusting to a new country  
- Build a community-driven platform where students share real experiences, not ads  
- Combine AI tools with human insight to keep content helpful and reliable

Problem  
Right now, many platforms mix helpful posts with sponsored content, paid promotions, or influencer advertising. Even well-known apps – like Xiaohongshu/Little Red Book – have valuable information, but users often have to filter through ads or biased recommendations.

For newly arrived international students, this creates real challenges: misleading housing listings, confusing/ unreliable advice, or suggestions shaped by marketing instead of real experience.

Solution  
A website designed specifically for new international students, featuring:

- Transportation guides  
- Places to find traditional foods and groceries  
- Safe, affordable housing experiences shared directly by students  
- Fraud and scam awareness  
- A safe system to connect to volunteers online  
- AI tools that answer quick questions, but with human-verified content to ensure accuracy  
- And more…

What Makes This Platform Different

- No sponsored posts disguised as advice  
- Experience-based sharing: students contribute their real housing experiences, grocery finds, transit tips, and survival advice  
- Helpfulness-based incentives: instead of a “like” button, posts can be shared or marked as helpful, rewarding content that truly benefits others  
- Community-first design: accuracy and student wellbeing are prioritized over advertising
